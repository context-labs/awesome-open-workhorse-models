# Open Workhorse Models

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Purpose-built, **open-weight** small language (and multimodal) models that enterprises actually use for **one** thingâ€”and do it extremely well. No general-purpose LLMs, no pre-2025 releases.

> As enterprises productionize AI, narrowly focused SLMs often beat general models on **accuracy, latency, cost, and control** for a given task (extraction, safety, coding agents, search). This list highlights those specialists with real-world traction and open weights.

## What qualifies for this list?

- **Specialized**: Excels at a **narrow, well-defined** task (extraction, safety, coding, embeddings/rerankers, etc.)
- **Open weights**: Training code/datasets optional but welcome
- **Enterprise adoption**: Public deployments, marketplace entries, enterprise docs, or similar signals
- **2025+** only: Initial release (or major refresh) in **2025 or later**
